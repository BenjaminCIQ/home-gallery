{{#modules.database}}
- Database mapper
{{/modules.database}}
{{#modules.extractor}}

## Extractor

The extractor reads, transforms or create information of an image
like exif data extraction (read), preview image generator (transforms)
or GEO address reverse lookup (create).

The extractor can use information from previous extractors and stores
its raw data in the storage. Structured data should be stored as JSON
file.
{{/modules.extractor}}
{{#modules.database}}

## Database Mapper

Based on the extracted raw data the database mapper maps different
information to database entries which can be viewed, searched and
filtered on the web application.

The database mapper should only map important information to the
database so that the browser can store and process all data of
the complete gallery.
{{/modules.database}}
{{#modules.query}}

## Query

A search query is parsted to an abstract syntax tree (AST) which is
evaluated to perform the final filtering for given database entries.

The query plugin can transform (optimize) the query AST and adds
custom filter and sorting capabilities to the query evaluation
{{/modules.query}}
